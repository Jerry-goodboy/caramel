Caramel is a simple, beautiful, modern website framework. Caramel is mobile compatiable, making you only need to write code once, to have the same results across multiple platforms.

## Modification
Modifying Caramel is easy with Sass, and our Compiling Script. Make your changes to Caramel, then run our Compiling Script to recompile your new code into CSS. 

**Please Note:** The Compiling Script only works on Linux and Mac OS X. Additionally, [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [Sass Command Line](http://sass-lang.com/install) must be installed for our Compiling Script to work.

### Syntax:

	path/to/compile.sh  path/to/caramel.scss
    
### Errors:

	-bash: path/to/compile.sh: Permission denied
* Solution: `chmod +x path/to/compile.sh`

## Compatibility
